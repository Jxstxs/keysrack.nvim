This Plugin binds other Bindings to your Keys with the given Group and removes
them when Finished.

                                                            *keystack.config()*
keystack.config({opts})

    Should be run before any other keystack functions. It initializes
    thethe plugin, sets the default options and adds the given mappings.
    The options are:
        default_opts: a table of options which will be used as default
                      when no options are given in the mappings.
        default_mode: the default mode to use when no mode is given in the
                      mappings.
        default_exit_key: the key to use when no exit key is given in the
                          mappings.
        mappings: a table of mappings. Each mapping is a table looking like:
            {
                maps: a table of keys and commands (keybinding = command)
                opts: a table of options
                mode: a string of the mode to bind the keys to
                exit_key: a string of the key to exit the mode
            }


                                                             *keystack.push()*
keystack.push({name})

    Applies the given Group to the Key map and adds it original state to the Stack.

                                                              *keystack.pop()*
keystack.pop({name})

    Removes the given Group from the Key map and restores the original state.
